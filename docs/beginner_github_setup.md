## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform that hosts code and allows developers to collaborate. Think of it as Google Drive for code, with powerful features for tracking changes and working together.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1. Open your web browser and go to [github.com](https://github.com)

2. You'll see this page:

## Step 2: Create a New Repository

## Step 4: Clone Your Repository

"Cloning" means downloading a copy of your repository to your computer.

1. In GitHub Desktop, click on your `confident-kids-app` repository in the list

## Step 5: Add the ConfidentKids Files

Now you'll add the ConfidentKids application files to your repository.

1. Extract the `confident-kids-app.zip` file you received

2. Open the folder where you cloned your repository (you can click "Show in Explorer" in GitHub Desktop)

3. Copy all files and folders from the extracted `confident-kids-app` folder into your repository folder
   - Make sure to copy the contents, not the folder itself
   - If asked about replacing files, choose "Replace the files in the destination"

4. Return to GitHub Desktop, and you'll see all the changed files listed

## Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes

"Committing" means saving your changes to the repository history. "Pushing" means uploading those changes to GitHub.

1. In GitHub Desktop, enter a summary of your changes in the "Summary" field
   - Example: "Initial commit of ConfidentKids application"
   
2. If you want, add a more detailed description in the "Description" field

3. Click "Commit to main"

5. Your files are now on GitHub! You can verify by going to your repository on github.com

## Step 7: Invite a Developer (If Needed)

If you're working with a developer, you can give them access to your repository.

1. Go to your repository on github.com

2. Click "Settings" (tab near the top)

5. Enter the developer's GitHub username or email address

6. Select their account and click "Add [username] to this repository"

7. They'll receive an invitation by email

## Step 8: Basic GitHub Concepts for Beginners

Here are some key concepts to understand:

- **Repository**: A folder containing your project files and their history
- **Commit**: A saved snapshot of your changes
- **Branch**: A separate version of your repository (the main one is called "main")
- **Push**: Uploading your commits to GitHub
- **Pull**: Downloading the latest changes from GitHub
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a repository
- **Fork**: Creating your own copy of someone else's repository
- **Pull Request**: Suggesting changes to be merged into a branch

## Step 9: Working with Your Developer

When working with your developer:

1. Make sure they have access to your repository (Step 7)

2. Share the `.env.example` file separately (it contains the structure for environment variables)

3. Provide them with any API keys or credentials they need (but never commit these to GitHub)

4. Use GitHub Issues to track tasks and bugs:
   - Go to the "Issues" tab in your repository
   - Click "New issue"
   - Enter a title and description
   - Assign it to your developer
   - Add labels if needed
   - Click "Submit new issue"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I can't push my changes"
- Make sure you've committed your changes first
- Check that you have an internet connection
- Verify that you have permission to push to the repository

### "I'm getting merge conflicts"
- This happens when the same file has been changed in different ways
- Ask your developer to help resolve these conflicts

### "I accidentally committed sensitive information"
- Contact your developer immediately to help remove it
- Consider changing any exposed passwords or API keys

### "I can't see my repository"
- Make sure you're logged in to the correct GitHub account
- Check that you're looking at your personal repositories, not an organization's

## Next Steps

After setting up your GitHub repository:

1. Share the repository URL with your developer
2. Follow the [Beginner-Friendly Development Environment Setup](./beginner_dev_environment_setup.md) guide
3. Configure [External Services with Updated Instructions](./updated_external_services_setup.md)
